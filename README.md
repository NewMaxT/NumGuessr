# NumGuessr
NumGuessr is a console number guessing game written in C#. The aim of the game is to guess a number randomly generated by the program.

## How to play
When you launch the game, you'll be asked to choose the lowest and highest number for the random number range. The game then generates a random number within this range and asks you to guess it.
If you guess correctly, you win! If not, the game reveals the number and asks if you want to play again.

## Installation
To install and run NumGuessr, download and run the .exe file.
Works only on Windows 10 and later platforms.
